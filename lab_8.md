##Discripton
The screenshot shows a Linux terminal session where the user is working with Bash scripts. The user navigates to the classwork directory and creates three shell scripts: system.sh, math.sh, and output.sh. The system.sh script retrieves system information, including hostname, OS details, and uptime. The math.sh script performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input, allowing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with an option to exit. The output.sh script also takes user input but its function isn't fully visible in the screenshot. The user edits these scripts using the nano text editor and executes them using the bash command.

##Commands used
cd Desktop
cd classwork
nano system.sh
bash system.sh
nano math.sh
bash math.sh
nano output.sh
bash output.sh
