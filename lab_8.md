# Experiment 8: 
Write shell scripts to print system information.
Write shell script to perform basic mathematical calculation.
Use redirection operators to store the output of commands.

## Description
This experiment involves creating and executing shell scripts in a Linux environment. The user navigates to the `classwork` directory and works with three scripts: `system.sh`, `math.sh`, and `output.sh`. 

- `system.sh` retrieves system information such as hostname, OS details, and uptime.  
- `math.sh` performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) based on user input, with an option to exit.  
- `output.sh` prompts the user for input, but its complete functionality is not visible in the screenshot.  

The scripts are edited using the `nano` text editor and executed using the `bash` command.
